v0.2:
-added change_notes
-Deprecated fix trailing commas script as game seems to use Json5, not Json format.
-Added Alphabetical Json sort for easier comparison of changes.
-Updated all scripts to Json5
-Added Example Usage

v0.3:
-fixed some files corrupted due to git revert push/rebase issues
-necessary json to json5 migration changes

v0.4:
-changed format of new id reporting script - for easy copy-paste of new ids (especially in trader file)
-added "only" and "only_ask" options in merge for directly adding new ids 
Note: ID and IDDs follow format of data -> ID so is not valid for trader.json file
-added a small script texture_renamer to rename textures of old mods [game cannot read old names]
(ex. Exotic Items Pack Mod was dead but works again with this!)
