WHAT IS THIS?

I've been running into errors with using mods. It seems that two dependencies of many mods - Json Override Framework and External Audio Framework may be broken thus causing the issue.
Many game files are in JSON and mods change those to add new items / modify existing ones.
Multiple mods require JSON of vanilla + different mods to be merged while Vortex handles rest of the files.

So, I made several scripts to use mods and also some scripts for personal use. Read each part to use properly and resolve doubts.



HOW TO RUN:

1. Right Click -> Run as Administrator -> run.exe [OPTIONAL - If getting errors]
2. Load JSON File -> scripts_config.json
3. Choose script to use -> Set field values -> Run 

# Run also saves changed field values before running script. There is OPTIONALLY a Save button to the right.

OPTIONAL:
2. Load JSON File -> Any Game JSON (Found under <Game_Folder>/ZS_vanilla\gamedata)
3. Manually edit values as desired -> Save

# Clicking Run here is meaningless



SCRIPTS:

1. fix_trailing_comma - 

Use: Fixes trailing commas of native and mod JSON files.

Reason: JSON format is necessary to run scripts. Trailing commas give errors in JSON files.
IMPORTANT - Good Practice is to run this on all Game and Mod JSON files first and replace them before doing anything else. Else other scripts may run into errors.

Fields: 
input_folder = folder name containing files to be changed
output_folder = folder name containing changed files
# ../. = Do NOT change. Points to location of folder containing run.exe



2. report_new_id.exe -
Use: Tracks new ids (items added) and new idds (added items under existing trader ids)

Reason: New items may break existing save. Remove or Add items as needed.

Fields: 
input_folder = folder name containing files to be changed
change_folder = folder name containing new files that show how files are to be changed
output_folder = folder name containing changed files
# ../. = Do NOT change. Points to location of folder containing run.exe
# example - input_folder = original or currently existing files, change_folder = mod_files desired to be integrated



3. field_editor.exe -

Use: Takes a particular field's value of all items. Adds adder to it and then multiplies by multiplier.
 

Reason: You may use to increase stack sizes by a multiplier (ex.10). In Difficulty Settings, divide Loot Amount by the same multiplier(ex. for 10, Amount of single item = 1.0 by default, so it should become 0.10). Else loot spawn will also increase by multiplier.

# In case of ongoing save file, open save file in text editor -> search and replace -> "loot_amount_single_item": 0.1
# Save file location by default: C:\Users\<User_Name>\AppData\Local\ZERO_Sievert\<Steam_ID>\save_shared_<slot_number>.dat
  
Any valid numerical fields in game JSON like stack_max, value, weight, damage may be adjusted.


Fields: 
input_folder = folder name containing files to be changed
output_folder = folder name containing changed files
# ../. = Do NOT change. Points to location of folder containing run.exe
adder: Integer value. Added first.
multiplier: Integer value. Multiplied second.


4. merge_json.exe -

Use: Merge the original or existing JSON files with the same JSON files from mods.

Reason: You may use to update items or add new items or use multiple mods together.
Many game files are in JSON and mods change those to add new items / modify existing ones.
Multiple mods require JSON of vanilla + different mods to be merged while Vortex handles rest of the files.


Fields: 
input_folder = folder name containing files to be changed
change_folder = folder name containing new files that show how files are to be changed - edit or add items
output_folder = folder name containing changed files
# ../. = Do NOT change. Points to location of folder containing run.exe
# example - input_folder = original or currently existing files, change_folder = mod_files desired to be integrated into existing files
# If multiple mods add same file, you must merge them multiple times ex. ammo.json of vanilla with mod1 first then move the output to input and merge with mod2
excluded_fields = array of fields that you don't want to be changed
array_merge_strategy - array of strings - ignore or merge or replace
new_id_strategy - ignore or merge
# Default is merge but this means new items will be added and new game needs to be started. Ignore setting to edit existing items and play ongoing save.
# ex. Array of strings are there in w_mod.json - weapon_id = [gun_ids this gun mod can be used with] and repair_weapon.json - caliber = [gun caliber_ids this repair kit can repair]
